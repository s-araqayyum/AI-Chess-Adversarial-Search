Problem Statement
In this assignment, you will be implementing a chess game using the Min-Max Algorithm with
Alpha-Beta Pruning. Chess is a two-player board game that is played on an 8x8 chessboard.
The game involves moving pieces across the board in an effort to capture the opponent's king.
The player who successfully captures the opponent's king wins the game.
Requirements:
1. Implement a chess game that can be played against the computer.
2. The computer will use the Min-Max Algorithm with Alpha-Beta Pruning to make its
moves.
3. The game should display the chessboard and pieces after each move.
4. The game should keep track of the moves made by both players.
5. The game should detect checkmate and declare the winner.
6. The game should detect stalemate and declare a draw.
7. The game should have a command line-based user interface to display the chessboard
and pieces. Good Luck! ðŸ˜Š
